    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I would like to create a website that gives the user an understanding of who I am and the work I do. It will showcase my resume, portfolio, and arrangement library. I hope to work in the entertainment industry. I'm not entirely sure whether it will be television, movies, or music, but don't want to limit myself to one specific section.<br> <br> This website will give peers and potential employers an idea of who I am and the work I do that relates to the entertainment industry. <br>I hope to have it consist of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resume Section</li>
            <li>Relevant Design work</li>
            <li>Past Performances</li>
            <li>A Cappella arrangements</li>
