    <h2>Very Clearly Chunked</h2>
    <div class="elevator"><p>My goal is to create a website that is legible. That way people can easily understand the point behind the content. </p></div></div>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I would like to create a website that gives the user an understanding of why chunking is important. It will showcase many different things, because who doesn't love looking at great examples of chunking? I encourage all web designers and other humans in general to understand and utilize chunking. This will definitely make life easier on all of us.<br> <br> This website will give peers and potential employers an idea of how to properly design web pages. <br>You can utilize chunking in lists! </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily read statements!</li>
            <li>Vital information!</li>
            <li>What a great thing to know!</li>
            <li>Aren't you happy this is in a list?</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Poor Chunking Example</h2>
      <p>Everything is so close together.
      <br>Unfortunately some people don't understand chunking. When there is too much information, it is already difficult to find the important parts.</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>When you have a lot of unnecessary information, people can get lost in the mix. I know when I have long articles to read for class or work, I generally try and skim for the important information. If the content is not chunked correctly, web pages can look messy, plain, and overwhelming. It is better to break up the content into more managable chunks in order to portray the important information. If you need people to know something, you need to break it from big paragraphs! Call 9-1-1 for emergencies. Most pepole would miss that prior sentence! Aren't you happy that you read through this entire paragraph? It would be beneficial to everybody to properly chunk their content.</p>
