    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I would like to create a website that gives the user an understanding of who I am and the work I do. It will showcase my resume, portfolio, and arrangement library. I hope to work in the entertainment industry. I'm not entirely sure whether it will be television, movies, or music, but don't want to limit myself to one specific section. This website will give peers and potential employers an idea of who I am and the work I do that relates to the entertainment industry. I hope to have it consist of a resume section, relevant design work, past performances, a library of my arrangements from my a cappella group, and a discussion section where I can post about whatâ€™s happening with my life. </p>
